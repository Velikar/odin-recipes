# odin-recipes
First work

This is a simple web app that contains a lists of recipes, that 
the user may be interested to consult from time to time, whether it
is to eat on their own or to share with family and friends.

By the end of this work, I should have improved my understanding
and knowledge of the HTML Basics, such as headings, simple texts,
lists, images, etc. 

Thanks for reading!
